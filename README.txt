ChanyaÂ´s oblig 3 implements and changes 

INFO:
This my version oblig 3 where i experimented with more interactivity on the site and js!
I want to make something i am proud of and felt something that was me and show my passion for web dev.
So for oblig 3 implements i kept the codes, concpet and the same story style but used my styles into this. 


what i did: 
- I used the current js codes i wanted to make and implement this project (a bit started froms scratch) to how i would make it.
something that felt more my style and me. I wanted to make it fun and interactive.
- i wanted to grab attention and make it more fun and informing than just making it a story. 
- instead i made it like a game where it is more modern and pleasing to a wider audience. 
- As someone who likes playing games like Terreria and Stardew Valley this style really inspired me to make this. 

the images:
- i hand drew these on this website: 
https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create/sprite/
- export it, add to illustrator and turn them into svgs!


Story & concept: 
- I kept the same concept as the first submission which was SDG 13 -climate action and earth not being listened to.
- I wanted this whole site to be more interactive along the way and keep it simple and lighter on the animations, js and images.
- I wanted it to be educational while also targetting youger audience from age 13+ 
- I made it look and feel like a game that is a familiar aesthetic and art style.  


Html: 
- same structure and content, just more spesific and using more classes 

SCSS: 
- Here i played around abit when making the text box. Instead of using an image i wanted to make it through scss 



JS: 
- gsap 
- appear in and out 
- text box appearing when scroll (scrolltrigger and section )
- smooth scrolling (scroll trigger) scroll to the section it was coded to.



Animations: 
- float 
- blink for the text box
