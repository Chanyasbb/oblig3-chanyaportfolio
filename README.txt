ChanyaÂ´s oblig 3 implements and changes 

Story & concept: 
- I kept the same concept as the first submission which was SDG 13 -climate action and earth not being listened to.
- I wanted this whole site to be more interactive along the way and keep it simple and lighter on the animations, js and images.
- I wanted it to be educational while also targetting youger audience from age 13+ 
- I made it look and feel like a game that is a familiar aesthetic and art style.  


Html:
