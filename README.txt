ChanyaÂ´s oblig 3 implements and changes 

INFO:
- This is an exstra version of the oblig 3 where i experimented with more interactivity on the site and js!
- using the current js codes i wanted to make and implement this project (a bit started froms scratch) to how i would make it.
something that felt more my style and me. I wanted to make it fun and interactive.
- i wanted to grab attention and make it more fun and informing than just making it a story. 
- instead i made it like a game where it is more modern and pleasing to a wider audience. 
- As someone who likes playing games like Terreria and Stardew Valley this style really inspired me to make this. 


Story & concept: 
- I kept the same concept as the first submission which was SDG 13 -climate action and earth not being listened to.
- I wanted this whole site to be more interactive along the way and keep it simple and lighter on the animations, js and images.
- I wanted it to be educational while also targetting youger audience from age 13+ 
- I made it look and feel like a game that is a familiar aesthetic and art style.  


Html: 
- same structure and content, just more spesific and using more classes 

SCSS: 
- Here i played around abit when making the text box. Instead of using an image i wanted to make it through scss 



JS: 
- gsap 
- appear in and out 
- text box appearing when scroll (scrolltrigger and section )
- smooth scrolling (scroll trigger) scroll to the section it was coded to.
